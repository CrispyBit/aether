# Builds

## [Build A](../builds/a.md)

Build A is designed to be easy to make by anyone. Solderless, plug-and-play, high quality sensors. An approachable way to teach IoT with .NET.

Ideas for Build A are:

- A small E-Ink screen to display some values and support pairing with Bluetooth.
- A 3D-printed case that hides a column of sensors/Pi behind a vase-like organic structure. Like large blades of grass, or wavey, with natural vents to bring fresh air to the sensors.
- RGB LEDs running up all sides of the device, that are animated with colors to indicate air quality anyone can see from afar. It would be amazing to have accessible options here for color blindness and visual impairments. A light sensor would auto-adjust brightness appropriate for the environment.

## Build B

"B" is for Budget. Use cost-effective parts, but still sufficient quality. Soldering probably required. May use a different case than Build A.
