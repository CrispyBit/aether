# Security

Because these will be fully functioning Linux devices, it is important to reduce surface area for attacks.

Aether's default mode should require no WiFi connection to operate. Bluetooth could be used for [connectivity to apps](Bluetooth%20Apps.md). LoRa could be used for [Mesh Networking](Mesh%20Network.md) to go even farther than WiFi. Together, something approaching or surpassing WiFi's level of usefulness can be built. WiFi should only be supported as a more cost-effective option for those willing to take the risk.
