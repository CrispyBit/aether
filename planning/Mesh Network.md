# Mesh Networking

Using LoRa, Aether devices could be placed very far distances (miles in open air) apart and be able to communicate with each-other in a mesh.

This would allow one of the [Bluetooth apps](Bluetooth%20Apps.md) to read from multiple sensors that cover an entire home or other large building beyond Bluetooth's range.

One important feature of Aether is to be more secure by [staying off your WiFi](Security.md). LoRa would allow this to happen.
